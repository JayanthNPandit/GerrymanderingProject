# GerrymanderingProject

Sorry the files are so messy. 

Better Code folder has the up-to-date .py code.

Map Making has the best looking maps generated by the code.

Both datasets folders have the zip files and trial sets used to debug the code.

Literature and Research has the papers we reviewed before starting work on the project.
